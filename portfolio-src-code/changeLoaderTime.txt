To change how long the loader runs for:
1. Navigate to  these four files: "./src/sections/Landing.tsx" line 10, "./src/pages/Projects.tsx" line 10,
 "./src/pages/Errorpage.tsx" line 7, "./src/components/Navbar.tsx" line 5
2. There is a variable named delaytime structured like so: "const delaytime: number = 4000;"
3. Change that value to a number that suits you. The value is in milliseconds. Note that in "./src/components/Navbar.tsx" line 5,
the value is actually in seconds hence "const delaytime: number = 4.5;". There is a delay of 500ms on top of the original 4000ms
so that the transition of the Navbar.tsx can be seen onload. So if delaytime is changed to 2000, then it should be changed to 2.5 in Navbar.tsx
